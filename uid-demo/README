== Load the Application to UID

The following steps are necessary to load the application into the UID board:

* Connect serial port (via debug adapter), network and power to UID.
* Start the Bootloader by pressing any key while booting
* Find out the IP-Address of the UID-Board with the command `ifconfig` on the
  bootloader console.
* Make sure, that your computer is in the same network.
* Upload the `b-br_uid/app.bin` to `/ffs/br_uid.bin` (or whatever is configured
  in `/ffs/br_uid.ini`) via ftp. A console command to do this would be `curl -T
  b-br_uid/app.bin ftp://192.168.100.74/ffs/br_uid.bin`
